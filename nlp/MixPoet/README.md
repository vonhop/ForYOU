The source code of [*MixPoet: Diverse Poetry Generation via Learning Controllable Mixed Latent Space*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06094.pdf) (AAAI 2020).

## 1. Rights
All rights reserved.

## 2. Requirements
* python>=3.7.0
* pytorch>=1.3.1
* sklearn>=0.19.2
* matplotlib>=2.2.3 

## 3. Data Preparation
To train the model and generate poems, please 

* add the training, validation and testing sets of our [THU-CCPC](https://github.com/THUNLP-AIPoet/Datasets/tree/master/CCPC) data into the *MixPoet/preprocess/*  directory;
* add the pingsheng.txt, zesheng.txt, pingshui.txt and pingshui_amb.pkl files of our [THU-CRRD](https://github.com/THUNLP-AIPoet/Datasets/tree/master/CRRD) set into the *MixPoet/data/*  directory.

We provide a small sampled subset of the labelled CQCF in the *preprocess*  directory to test these codes. We will consider releasing the full CQCF set in the future.  You can also use your own data.

## 4. Preprocessing
In Mixpoet/preprocess/, just run:
```
python preprocess.py --n 150000
```
The parameter *n* indicates the number of unlabelled instances to be used for semi-supervised training. When one uses the provided sampled CQCF set, we recommend *n* is about 150,000. With a larger labelled dataset, one can set a larger *n*.

After running preprocess.py, please move the generated vocab.pickle, ivocab.pickle, semi_train.pickle and semi_valid.pickle into *MixPoet/corpus/*,  and move test_inps.txt and training_lines.txt into *MixPoet/data/*.

## 5. Training
In MixPoet/codes/, run:
```
python train.py
```
The encoder and decoder will be pre-trained as a denoising autoencoder, and the classifiers will be pre-trained with the labelled poems. Then the MixPoet model is trained based on these pre-trained modules.

One can also edit MixPoet/codes/**config.py**  to modify the configuration, such as the hidden size, embedding size, data path, training epoch, learning rate and so on.

During the training process, some training information is outputed, such as:

<div align=center><img width="81%" height="81%" src="pictures/p3.png"/></div>

The training and validation information is saved in MixPoet/log/.

## 6. Generation
To generate a poem in an interactive interface, in MixPoet/codes/, run:
```
python generate.py -v 1
```
Then one can input the keyword, length and factor labels, and then get the generated pome:

<div align=center>
<img width="70%" height="70%" src="pictures/p5.png"/>
<img width="70%" height="70%" src="pictures/p6.png"/>
</div>


By running:
```
python generate.py -v 1 -s 1
```
one can manually select each generated line from the beam candidates.

To generate poems with an input testing file, which contains a set of keywords, run:
```
python generate.py -m file -l 5 -i ../data/test_inps.txt -o outs_5char.txt
```
where l = 5 or 7, indicating the 5-char-line or 7-char-line quatrains.
